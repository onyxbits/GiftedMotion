# Notes on keys:
# 1. The key begins with the classname where it is used relative to 
#    de.onyxbits.giftedmotion
# 2. After the classname comes the field or methodname, where the key is
#    used in the class. For the constructor, the classname is repeated.
# 3. All keys are lowercase and a dot is used as a seperator.
